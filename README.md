# uber_data_engineering

Managed end-to-end data flow, including data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). Leveraged Python and SQL in Google Cloud for data processing. Developed robust ETL pipelines in Mage VM to streamline data integration. Utilized Looker for insights and scalable data solutions.

1. Leveraged Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and Lucidapp for creating data model diagrams, facilitating data transformation.
2. Designed a data model comprising a fact table with primary and foreign keys to seamlessly connect dimension tables.
3. Employed Google Cloud Storage for storing Uber's raw data, followed by the use of Mage VM to extract data through Python APIs and transform it with pandas.
4. Loaded data into Google BigQuery, enabling efficient data management.
5. Executed SQL queries for data analysis and harnessed Looker for compelling data visualization, delivering valuable insights.
