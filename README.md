# uber_data_engineering

Managed end-to-end data flow, including data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). Leveraged Python and SQL in Google Cloud for data processing. Developed robust ETL pipelines in Mage VM to streamline data integration. Utilized Looker for insights and scalable data solutions.

1. Utilized Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and Lucidchart for data model diagram creation, streamlining data transformation.
2. Designed a data model with a fact table and primary and foreign keys to ensure seamless connections with dimension tables.
3. Employed Google Cloud Storage to store Uber's raw data and built data pipelines using Mage AI, enabling data extraction through APIs using Python, transformation with pandas, and loading into Google BigQuery for efficient data management.
4. Executed SQL queries for data analysis and leveraged Looker for compelling data visualization, delivering valuable insights.
